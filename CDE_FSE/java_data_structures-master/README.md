# TDD with Red Green Refactor

Red, green, refactor (RGR) is a procedure used in TDD to help you develop applications.

Red is the initial state of all tests. For this exercise, they are provided for you. However, you'll write your own tests in the real world. With that in mind, take note of how the tests have been written and how they stick to the basics. Aside from JUnit, no additional tools required. All you need is an understanding of the problems you're solving.

Green is the first step towards developing an effective solution. The main priority is simply getting the test green. This is NOT the step to worry about efficiency, beauty or technique. At this stage, armed with an understanding of what you're trying to build, try to visualize how you anticipate using the application. Your tests are the first client.

Refactor is the final step and at this stage your tests should be stable. You'll need it in order to refactor the code and develop it further. The tests are used at this stage to let you know when you've broken something and to identify where the problems are.

## Instructions

For this exercise, the tests have been provided. Focus on pair-programming and the red, green, refactor procedure to make the tests pass.

- Tests should not be altered.
- Focus on making the tests pass first.
- Uncomment the test methods one at a time, making sure all tests pass before you move on to the next.
